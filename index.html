    <p id="quote">“It is the function of science to discover the existence of a general reign of order in nature and to
      find the causes
      governing this order. And this refers in equal measure to the relations of man - social and political - and to the
      entire universe as a whole.”<br><span>― Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev</span></p>
